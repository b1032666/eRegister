eRegister

Assignment 2, eRegister

This github repository was made in order for me to progress through my second assignment 
for my Web Architectures course at Sheffield Hallam University.

The assignment was to produce an electronic online eRegister in which tutors and students could log onto and 
fill in an online register to help track students attendance.

Although the project is not completed I believe I have a good solid basis for the project to be improved
on in later builds.
