eRegister
=========

Assignment 2, eRegister

This github repository was made in order for me to progress through my second assignment 
for my Web Architectures course at Sheffield Hallam University.

The assignment was to produce an electronic online eRegister in which tutors and students could log onto and 
fill in an online register to help track students attendance.

Although the project is not completed I believe I have a good solid basis for the project to be improved
on in later builds.



If you wish to have a look at this project and give it a run then by all means do so.
In order for you do do this go into your terminal and use the command

    git clone git@github.com:b1032666/eRegister.git
    
This should copy the entire repositry of the project.

From here I think you should be able to have a look at all of the files I have done and be able to run
the web app by doing

    grails run-app
